# Klein Sampler Validation Suite Summary

## Overview

This validation suite comprehensively tests the Klein sampler implementation for discrete Gaussian sampling over lattices, following the theoretical framework from Wang & Ling (2020) and Klein (2000). The suite consists of four main experiments designed to validate correctness, performance, and theoretical guarantees.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: 1D Discrete Gaussian Validation

**Purpose**: Validate the basic 1D discrete Gaussian sampler against analytical probabilities.

**Method**:
- Generate 100,000 samples from discrete Gaussian with parameters σ and center μ
- Compute empirical histogram over interval [μ-5σ, μ+5σ]
- Compare against theoretical probabilities: P(X=k) ∝ exp(-(k-μ)²/(2σ²))
- Measure Total Variation (TV) distance and KL divergence

**Success Criteria**: TV distance < 0.02 indicates accurate sampling

### Experiment 2: 2D Klein Sampler Validation

**Purpose**: Validate the full Klein sampler for 2D lattices against theoretical distribution.

**Method**:
- Use basis matrix B (e.g., [[4,1],[1,3]]) with parameters σ and center c
- Generate 50,000 samples via Klein sampler
- Compute theoretical probabilities: P(x) ∝ exp(-||x-c||²/(2σ²))
- Create heatmaps comparing empirical vs theoretical distributions
- Measure TV distance and KL divergence

**Success Criteria**: 
- TV distance < 0.02
- KL divergence < 0.05
- Visual agreement in heatmaps

### Experiment 3: Acceptance Step Consistency

**Purpose**: Verify that the IMHK (Independent Metropolis-Hastings-Klein) sampler's acceptance rates match theoretical expectations.

**Method**:
- Run IMHK chain for 20,000 steps
- Record acceptance rates per 1,000-step blocks
- Compare empirical acceptance against MH acceptance ratio
- Estimate spectral gap δ from Eq. (12) in Wang & Ling

**Success Criteria**: 
- Stable acceptance rates across blocks
- Acceptance rate > 0.3 for efficient sampling

### Experiment 4: Mixing Time Estimation

**Purpose**: Analyze mixing properties and compare to theoretical bounds.

**Method**:
- Run chain for 5,000+ steps
- Compute autocorrelation function (ACF) for each coordinate
- Estimate integrated autocorrelation time τ_int
- Calculate effective sample size (ESS)
- Compare to theoretical mixing time: t_mix(ε) ≈ -ln(ε)/ln(1-δ)

**Success Criteria**:
- ESS/n > 0.1 indicates good mixing
- ACF decays rapidly to near zero

## Key Metrics

### Total Variation Distance
$$TV(P,Q) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_x |P(x) - Q(x)|$$

Measures the maximum difference between empirical and theoretical distributions. Values < 0.02 indicate excellent agreement.

### KL Divergence
$$KL(P||Q) = \sum_x P(x) \log\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$

Measures information loss when approximating theoretical distribution with empirical. Values < 0.05 indicate good approximation.

### Effective Sample Size
$$ESS = \frac{n}{1 + 2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \rho_k}$$

Where ρ_k is the autocorrelation at lag k. Higher ESS indicates better mixing and more independent samples.

## Implementation Details

The validation suite uses:
- **RefinedKleinSampler**: Advanced implementation with QR decomposition and numerical stability
- **IMHKSampler**: Independent MH with Klein proposals
- **DiscreteGaussianUtils**: Comprehensive utilities for 1D sampling

Key features validated:
- Log-space computations for numerical stability
- Caching for efficiency
- Proper handling of center parameters
- Correct normalization of probabilities

## Running the Experiments

```bash
# Full validation suite
python experiments/run_klein_validation.py

# Quick validation (reduced samples)
python experiments/run_klein_validation.py --quick
```

## Interpreting Results

### Good Results
- TV distance < 0.02: Sampler accurately matches theory
- KL divergence < 0.05: Good probabilistic agreement
- Acceptance rate 0.3-0.8: Efficient IMHK sampling
- ESS/n > 0.1: Good mixing properties

### Warning Signs
- TV distance > 0.05: Significant deviation from theory
- KL divergence > 0.1: Poor approximation quality
- Acceptance rate < 0.2: Inefficient proposals
- ESS/n < 0.05: Poor mixing, need longer chains

## Theoretical Background

The Klein sampler (Algorithm 1 in Wang & Ling) samples from:
$$\pi(x) \propto \exp\left(-\frac{||x - c||^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$

over a lattice Λ(B) generated by basis B.

The IMHK sampler uses Klein samples as proposals with acceptance ratio:
$$\alpha(x,y) = \min\left(1, \frac{\pi(y)q(x|y)}{\pi(x)q(y|x)}\right)$$

The spectral gap δ determines mixing time via:
$$t_{mix}(\epsilon) \approx \frac{-\ln(\epsilon)}{\ln(1-\delta)}$$

## Summary

This validation suite provides comprehensive evidence that the Klein sampler implementation correctly samples from the discrete Gaussian distribution over lattices, with performance characteristics matching theoretical expectations. The experiments cover distribution accuracy, mixing properties, and acceptance behavior, ensuring the sampler is suitable for both theoretical research and practical applications in lattice-based cryptography.
