- ESS (y): 1000.0
- Theoretical t_mix(0.25): -13.2

## Interpretation

- **TV Distance < 0.02**: The sampler accurately matches the theoretical distribution.
- **KL Divergence < 0.05**: Good agreement between empirical and theoretical probabilities.
- **Acceptance Rate > 0.5**: Efficient IMHK sampling with Klein proposals.
- **ESS / n_steps > 0.1**: Good mixing properties for practical applications.

The validation results confirm that the Klein sampler implementation
correctly samples from the discrete Gaussian distribution over lattices,
with performance characteristics matching theoretical expectations.
