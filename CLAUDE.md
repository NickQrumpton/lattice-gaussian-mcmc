# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a research project focused on lattice Gaussian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The codebase is currently being initialized.

## Development Environment

*To be documented as the project structure is established*

## Build and Run Commands

*To be documented once build system is set up*

## Testing

*To be documented once testing framework is established*

## Code Architecture

*To be documented as the codebase develops*

## Key Concepts

This project likely involves:
- Gaussian processes on lattice structures
- MCMC sampling algorithms
- Statistical computing and numerical methods

*This section will be expanded as the implementation progresses*
